# [Coolest Projects 2013](http://coolestprojects.org)

This application was created for the "Coolest Projects" 2013 event at Dublin City University. It will be used to allow attendees to:

 - Vote for projects through a QR reader
 - Part-take in a competition to be the most active by causing activity on the accelerometer
 - View and share messages on the events message stream.
 - See the Schedule for the day 
 
This application was created by mentors of Coderdojo DCU. It makes use of the following popular frameworks: 

- Phonegap
- Backbone
- UnderScroll
- FastClick

The application has been tried and tested on iOS and Android 4.0.0. Builds of the application can be found at [build.phonegap.com](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/488448/share)

Your additions are most welcome. :-)
